# Proxy-Digger - Parallel Proxy Scraper & Checker
Proxy-Digger is a fork of Lunus BPS, a tool to obtain proxies and verify if they are valid in real-time. We have added support for HTTP/s, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5. When verifying the proxies, your computer might slow down a bit due to the threads.

This Version is a reworked version of the original Lunus BPS, which was made by [some hackers(?)](https://github.com/H4cK3dR4Du/LunusBPS).
I've completely rewrite all codebase, added a lot of new features and fixed some bugs.
I've also added a new UI and use httpX instead of requests.
I've added a proxy backup feature, so you can always go back to the previous scan.
I've added command-line arguments, so you can configure the program without the need to edit the code.
