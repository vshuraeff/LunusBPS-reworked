# Reworked Lunus BPS - Proxy Scraper & Checker
NB: Lunus BPS is a tool to obtain proxies and verify if they are valid in real-time. We have added support for HTTP/s, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5. When verifying the proxies, your computer might slow down a bit due to the threads.

This Version is a reworked version of the original Lunus BPS, which was made by [Lunus](https://gitgub.com/Lunus). I've added a lot of new features and fixed some bugs. I've also added a new UI and use httpX instead of requests.
